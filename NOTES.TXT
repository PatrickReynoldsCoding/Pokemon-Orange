EARLY IDEA:

class PlayerInfo
    attr_accessor :hp, :attack, :defence, :speed, :special # these symbols are the attributes for the "bulbasaur" objects we're creating below
  
   
  
    def initialize(hp, attack, defence, speed, special) # these parameters are just place names for the values we'll be entering in each new bulbasaur
      @hp = hp # these are instance variables that are usable by all methods in this class; they will be linked to the attributes  listed above. i.e @attack = :attack
      @attack = attack
      @defence = defence
      @speed = speed
      @special = special
    end
  end
